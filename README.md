# IntroQuestions
Here is where you are going to perform some algorithmic practices to get familiar with coding in different environments. All three questions are leet code easy and can be done with any language to familiarize yourself with the new syntax. Submit your solutions after forking the repository into your own work space, take the question and present solving the questions in a doccumented format. The excercise is to build up experience with programming if you are a new beginner in addition to having you interact with github for better version control. Overtime this repository will be changed and build, finally I am also trying to get you guys more familiar with contributing to repositories as consistency in version control looks good in resumes.
